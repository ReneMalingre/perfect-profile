After graduation she initially worked at a commercial practice, and for the next 4 or 5 years she consulted at an ophthalmology practice where she triaged and helped manage pre- and post-operative eye surgery patients . She prides herself in providing high quality patient-centred care and is passionate about making sure every patient understands their ocular condition and the process of treatment. When she’s not working, Rebekah spends her leisure time practicing classical ballet at her local dance studio and keeping company with her budgie, Chip.",

Contact lenses and Myopia Control are his big passions at work, along with continuing to build and develop Adelaide Eye Care as a leading private independent optometry practice. Rene loves spending time with Liz and his teenage daughter Lauren. He enjoys getting fit, and getting unfit, in equal measure. ",
