Header & Footer:

Background Color: Deep Sky Blue (#00BFFF)
Text Color: White (#FFFFFF)
Selected Text Color: Goldenrod (#DAA520)
Page Background (since very little is seen):

Color: Pale Turquoise (#AFEEEE) - This soft hue gives an open feeling and complements the deep sky blue of the header and footer.
Panels (in the 2x2 grid):

Background Color: White (#FFFFFF) or very light gray (#FAFAFA) for a bit more contrast
Text Color: Dim Gray (#696969) - This is softer than pure black and is easy on the eyes.
Heading Color: Midnight Blue (#191970) - This darker blue can act as a softer contrast to the deep sky blue and gives a professional appearance.
Margins on the Page (for larger screens):

Color: Powder Blue (#B0E0E6) - This gives a soft distinction from the page background and complements the overall blue theme.
